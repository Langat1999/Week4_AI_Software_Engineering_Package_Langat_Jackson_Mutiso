# TODO List for Completing Week 4 Assignment Practical Implementations

## Step 1: Edit ai_code_completion.py ✅
- Add imports for time module.
- Add sample data and timing functions to compare execution time of manual vs AI-suggested sorting functions.
- Add a ~200-word analysis in comments/docstring comparing efficiency, robustness, and preference.

## Step 2: Edit selenium_test.py ✅
- Update URL to https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login.
- Add logic to test valid credentials (expect success) and invalid credentials (expect failure).
- Print success/failure messages.
- Add driver.save_screenshot('login_test_result.png') after tests.
- Add a ~150-word summary in comments on how AI improves test coverage over manual testing.

## Step 3: Edit predictive_analytics.ipynb ✅
- Replace pd.read_csv with sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer().
- Add preprocessing: handle missing values, encode labels if needed, split data.
- Train RandomForestClassifier.
- Predict on test set and compute/print accuracy, F1-score, and classification report.

## Step 4: Install Dependencies (if needed) ✅
- Run pip install selenium sklearn pandas (assuming Python environment).

## Step 5: Run and Test Scripts ✅
- Execute ai_code_completion.py to see timing outputs.
- Execute selenium_test.py to run tests and generate screenshot.
- Run predictive_analytics.ipynb to train model and output metrics.

## Step 6: Update README.md (if needed) ✅
- Add references to completed deliverables (e.g., screenshot file, metrics).

## Step 7: Final Verification ✅
- Ensure all outputs (screenshots, metrics) are captured for the report.
